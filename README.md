# Real-Time Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
This project is a real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance system for manufacturing equipment. It uses synthetic data to simulate machine behavior, processes the data using a Flask API, and provides interactive visualizations via a Plotly Dash dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time data generation for machines, including temperature, cycle count, and status.
- Predictive model for detecting potential failures based on historical patterns.
- RESTful API for fetching machine data and making real-time maintenance predictions.
- Interactive dashboard to visualize machine data and alerts.
